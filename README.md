“'It’s harder to get around, and it is harder to find transportation access and also access to housing,' ...  

An estimated 54 percent of the respondents believe it is more difficult to get around the Bay Area than it was a year ago, the poll determined. That’s up sharply from the 37 percent who felt that way in 2015 and more than double the 25 percent with that assessment in 2014."

H1B Visa Reports were created based Labor Condition Applications (LCA) filed by U.S. employers in fiscal year(1 October-30 September). The number of LCA includes new, renewed, transferred and cap-exempt LCA.

Work cities were selected for inclusion in the data set based on their rank and the presence of new IT employers during the 10 year period reported.

Before the H-1B, H-1B1 or E-3 visa petition can be filed with USCIS, the employer must fill a Labor Condition Application(LCA) with the Department of Labor(DOL) through the iCERT Portal System no more than 6 months before the initial date of intended employment, demonstrating that it is paying the required wage for this position in the geographic region where the job is located. The employer may use a single LCA to request multiple positions where they are in the same visa category and job classification, and are either all part-time or all full-time positions.
