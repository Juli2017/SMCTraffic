“'It’s harder to get around, and it is harder to find transportation access and also access to housing,' ...  

An estimated 54 percent of the respondents believe it is more difficult to get around the Bay Area than it was a year ago, the poll determined. That’s up sharply from the 37 percent who felt that way in 2015 and more than double the 25 percent with that assessment in 2014."

San Mateo County is positioned between San Francisco to the north and Santa Clara County to the south.  Across San Francisco Bay to the east is Alameda County.  The large coastal portion of the County is separated from the inland portion by the Santa Cruz Mountains, which have limited roadways going west to east.  Access between the North and East Bay is limited by the four bridges: the Golden Gate Bridge going north out of San Francisco, the Bay Bridge is the the direct road between San Francisco and Oakland in Alameda County the San Mateo Bridge (Hwy 92) crossing the San Francisco Bay from San Mateo County to Alameda County, and the Dumbarton Bridge running from Menlo Park (very near the Facebook campus) east to Fremont in Alameda County.

The number of commuters between San Mateo County and Alamdea County is the only one that shows more workers commuting in that out.  This may reflect the difference in housing costs between the two counties, where Alameda County was considered a more affordable place to live relative to San Mateo County.
